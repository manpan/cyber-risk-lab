title: Our Mission
---
The mission of the Cyber Risk Lab (CRL) is to tackle research challenges within the field of cyber risk management and the goal to invent methods to supoort cyber security decision-makers with their constant ''fights'' against cyber threats.
CRL's research focus is on the lifecycle of cyber risk minimisation process. By using well-known cyber knowledge bases (e.g. CVEs, MITRE TTPs), our research brings together cyber practice and applied mathematics to tackle cyber risk challenges. Prominent part of our work is the development of tools to support optimal strategies and decisions when addressing these challenges.

CRL's research on cyber risk management studies how to address risk from different yet complementary perspectives to bring context to the overall security of the underlying environment (IoT, healthcare, domestic, SME, automotive). Our research commences with a phase of risk assessment (vulnerability-based, threat-based, and control-based), continuouing with the study of pre-emptive cyber risk controls, identification of threats, and reactive responses. Post-incident analysis within the context of cyber forensics has also been studied as part of CRL's interests. We then model the interaction of cyber controls, their costs (time, people), and benefits in improving cyber risk. Depending on the underlying use case, CLR's research proposes optimal ways to achieve security compliance, optimal return-on-security-investment (ROSI), and understandable ways for the decision-maker to communicate their decision to stakeholders prior to cyber investment decisions.

CRL's members include postdoctoral researchers, PhD students, MSc students, Software Developers, and undergraduate students all working in topics relevant to cyber risk management. CRL is based at the University of Greenwich yet has also established external collaborations with other academic groups and industrial partners.

Academic partners working closely with CRL members are City University of London, Imperial College, UCL, Queen Mary University of London, University of Bristol, University of Reading, University of Piraeus Research Centre, University of Delft, University of Surrey, University of Houston. Industrial partners have collaborated in the past or currently collaborate with CRL include the IASME Consortium, BT, Nokia, Phillips, ATOS, NEC, Intrasoft International, Ubitech Limited, Almerys, Schneider Electric, and Engineering.

CRL's recent work has been funded by the National Center for Cyber Security (NCSC), the EPSRC, and the European Commission.
